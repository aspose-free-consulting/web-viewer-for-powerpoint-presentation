# Web Viewer for PowerPoint Presentation

This consulting project uses Aspose.Slides to create a web viewer to show powerpoint slides on the web page.
You can reuse this code to embed PowerPoint slides inside a web page to view them as an online presentation viewer. 
This is a basic version of this viewer and you can reuse this to add more bells and whistles.
